# Music Student Organizer App

Final Project for my Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. An application that helps music students organize their music and keep everything stored in one convenient location.

## USER STORY

- Students will be able to log in and see copies of their music (for now, they will be linked as a Google document). 

- Students will be able to see when their lessons are and plan accordingly.

- Students will be able to add a link to an example performance of their music to study from.

- Students will be able to add practice logs to set goals for themselves and keep themselves accountable between lessons.

- Students will be able to edit their contact information if it changes.
